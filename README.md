## This specialization consists of five courses:

<ol>
   <li>Deep Neural Networks</li>
   <li>Improving Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization</li>
   <li>Structuring Machine Learning Projects</li>
   <li>Convolutional Neural Networks</li>
   <li>Sequence Models</li>
</ol> 
 
Of these five courses, I have completed the first four.
  
This is my GitHub repo containing all the assignments for the courses.

#### Note: It is not recommended to copy assignments, do your own work!
